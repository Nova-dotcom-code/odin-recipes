    <h3>Steps for preparing Jollof Rice</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the blended tomatoes, red bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet peppers to the pot. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic, thyme, curry powder (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir well to coat the rice with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.</li>
        <li>If using protein, you can add it during the last 10 minutes of cooking to allow it to heat through.</li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Enjoy your delicious Jollof Rice!</li>
